Welcome! My name is Lisa Guerra but I go by Lisa “War”, since Guerra means ‘war’ in Spanish. [I grew up... I value... I love McAllen community... I became a lawyer because I believe in...]

I am a bilingual lawyer licensed in Texas, New York, and the District of Columbia, with nearly 20 years of experience across a wide variety of legal practice areas. I run my own private practice law firm and am passionate about providing mediation services to help clients resolve difficult issues without the need for costly litigation.
At Texas RioGrande Legal Aid (TRLA), I was a Staff Attorney on the Migrant Farmworker & Employment Law Teams predominantly representing local low-income and migrant agricultural workers - including H-2A agricultural guest workers - with a variety of employment law claims, usually in federal courts across the country including, but not limited to Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wyoming, and Georgia. Lisa also assisted with the Disaster Relief, Income Tax, Immigration, and Consumer Law Teams at TRLA. While assisting asylum seekers in 2016-2018, I won a defensive asylum case for a detainee in Port Isabel.

My interest in helping clients resolve matters productively through mediation emerged in part from a renewed recognition of the value of life. The recent passing of my brother, Mark C. Guerra, moved me to measure my wealth not in money, but in time and relationships. After a self-imposed sabbatical, I returned to my legal practice with a renewed purpose to focus on cases that I believe are truly worthwhile and where I believe I can make a difference.
